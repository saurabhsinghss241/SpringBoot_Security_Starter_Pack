# JWT Implementation<br>

## Theory <br>

What is JWT?<br>
Json Web Token is a way to authorize requests without managing states or sessions.<br><br>

How we achieve this?<br>
We achieve this stateless behaviour by providing a token to the user containing all the information.<br>
User can send this token in subsquent request and based on this token we will authorize the user.<br>

Problem -<br>
Anyone can view the content of these token ðŸ˜­ using a base64 decoder.<br>
So how can we ensure that the user that is sending the token with the given information is the real user.<br>

Solution -<br>
All these token are signed by a Secret Key which only the server knows that is issuing these tokens.<br>
Suppose someone finds out the data from the token and trie's to send another token with same content but then he will have to encode the information using a Secret Key which will not with our server key.<br>
So our server will know that this token is tampered.<br><br>

JWT is used for authorization and you need to handle authentication on your.<br><br>

Workflow<br>
Authentication - Will be done using username and password.<br>
Authorization - Will be done using JWT.<br>

Authenticate a user using username password and return a JWT.<br>
Subsquent request will send this Token in Authorization Header and based on this token requests will be authorized.<br>

Implementation<br>
First we will handle Authentication.<br>
We will create a controller with endpoint "/api/auth/token" this will authenticate the user based on username and password provided by user.<br>
Then Authorization for this we will create a filter that will intercept all incomming request and check if the Authorization header contains a valid token or not.<br><br>

Lets Implement Authentication<br>
We discussed earlier the Authentication workflow in spring security.<br>
Key Components <br>
Authentication obj<br>
AuthenticationManager<br>
AuthenticationProvider<br>
UserDetailsService<br><br>

We have already implemented UserDetailsService, AuthenticationProvider and in default flow we only need to provide these two and internally Spring uses AuthenticationManager to authenticate a user.<br>
But now we have to manually do it.<br>
So we will need AuthenticationManager and Authentication.<br><br>

How to get AuthenticationManager?<br>
We can get this from WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class we have to override an existing method authenticationManagerBean this will return AuthenticationManager.<br>
Make sure to annotate this method with @Bean because we need this in our token generator controller.<br>

```sh
@Override
@Bean
public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception {
    return super.authenticationManagerBean();
}
```
<br>
Ok now we have AuthenticationManager now we need an instance Authentication because to authenticate AuthenticationManager needs an instance of Authentication containing user credentials.<br><br>

Authentication is an interface so we have to use an implementation of this.<br>
We are going to use UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.<br>
Create an instance of UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken
and add credentials in it.<br>

```sh
new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
        jwtRequest.getUsername(),
        jwtRequest.getPassword()
)
```
<br>
jwtRequest is a DTO for capturing username, password from the client.<br>

Now we will pass this instance of Authentication to AuthenticationManager.<br>

```sh
authenticationManager.authenticate(
        new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(
                jwtRequest.getUsername(),
                jwtRequest.getPassword()
        )
);
```
<br>
We have already provided the AuthenticationProvider and UserDetailsService in our SecurityConfiguration.<br>

AuthenticationManager will use those to authenticate our user.<br>
If credentials are invalid an exception of type BadCredentialsException<br>
will be thrown we need to handle this.<br>
```sh
catch (BadCredentialsException ex){
    // This will be triggered if authentication fails.
    // Username or Password is incorrect.
    throw new Exception("User Credentials are incorrect.");
}
```
<br>
If cred are correct user is authenticated now we need to create a token for this user so that he for subsquent request he can use the token to authorize.<br>

Let's do this <br>
To generate token we will use JWTUtil class containg methods to generate and validate JWT.<br><br>

We will use generate method of this which takes UserDetails.<br>
Get UserDetails using username that we recieved from user in requeset body.<br>
We will get this token send this back to user.<br>

Authentication Done.<br>
