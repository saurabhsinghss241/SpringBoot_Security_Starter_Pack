# SpringBoot_Security_Starter_Pack<br><br>

**Objective**<br>
I created this repo to implement Spring Security concepts that I am learning.<br><br>

### What is implemented in this branch.<br>
- CRUD for User, Role and Privilege.<br>
- All data will be stored in Postgres Database using Spring Data JPA.<br>
- If you also want to use postgreSQL you can create an instance only in few minutes and don't have to worry about installing postgreSQL in your system.<br><br>

**Steps**<br>
- Go to https://www.elephantsql.com/<br>
- Register and it will provide you a postgre instance.<br>
- Configure your application.properties file.<br><br>
### What is pending?<br>
- We have to add some kind of Authentication to protect our API endpoints.<br>
- We will achieve this using various techniques.<br><br>
**Refer BasicAuth, BasicAuthJPA and JWTImplementation branch for Authentication and Authorization implementation using Spring Security.**
